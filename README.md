# ClusterFlux

ClusterFlux is a companion application to the Flux Cluster Template project. It simplifies the configuration and management of Kubernetes clusters using GitOps principles, specifically tailored to work seamlessly with the Flux Cluster Template.

## Features

- **GitOps Workflow**: Manage your Kubernetes cluster configuration and application deployments using a GitOps approach in conjunction with the Flux Cluster Template.
- **Automated Synchronization**: ClusterFlux keeps your Flux Cluster Template in sync with your Kubernetes cluster, ensuring the desired state is maintained.
- **Application Deployment**: Easily deploy applications to your Kubernetes cluster by leveraging the Flux Cluster Template's capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with ClusterFlux as a companion application to the Flux Cluster Template, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the ClusterFlux repository to your local machine:

    ```shell

    git clone https://github.com/snoopy82481/clusterflux.git

    ```

2. **Configuration**: Customize the config.yaml file according to your cluster requirements and desired GitOps workflow, aligned with the Flux Cluster Template configuration.

3. **Build and Run**: Build and run the ClusterFlux application:

    ```shell

    go run main.go

    ```

    The application will start and continuously synchronize your Flux Cluster Template with your Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Integrate with Flux Cluster Template**: Integrate ClusterFlux with your existing Flux Cluster Template. Update your Flux configuration to include references to ClusterFlux, allowing it to manage and reconcile your cluster state.

Refer to the Flux Cluster Template documentation for detailed instructions on how to integrate ClusterFlux effectively.
